description: Simplify authentication with copy-paste ready code. Lightweight, customizable, and entirely yours to control.
---

This is **NOT** an authentication library in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a set of ready-to-use authentication components that you can copy and paste into your projects, whether they use Next.js.

**What do you mean by not a library?**

It means you don't need to install it as a dependency. AuthEz isn't distributed through npm. You simply take the code you need, integrate it into your app, and customize it as you see fit. This approach gives you complete control over both the authentication flow and the user experience.

_Think of AuthEz as a toolkit you can adapt to build your own authentication solution, without unnecessary dependencies._

		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The main goal of AuthEz is to give developers full control and flexibility. By copying the code directly into your project, you can customize it to your exact needs.

This approach avoids issues of tightly coupled styling and implementation that often come with packaged libraries. With AuthEz, the design and flow of authentication can be tailored entirely to your application's requirements.
